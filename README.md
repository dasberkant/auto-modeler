## 1. Purpose

Auto-Modeler is a cross-platform application designed to assist users in solving deterministic Operations Research (OR) problems. It aims to streamline the process from problem statement to a verified solution by:

*   Ingesting a plain-language description of any deterministic OR problem (linear, mixed-integer, network flow, etc.).
*   Automatically formulating the mathematical model (sets, indices, parameters, variables, objective, constraints) and displaying it in textbook style (LaTeX-rendered with a plaintext fallback).
*   Allowing the user to run the model in an open-source LP/MILP solver (default: Python + PuLP/OR-Tools) with a single click.
*   Generating, running, and displaying the solver code in Python transparently.
*   Implementing self-healing capabilities:
    *   If runtime or syntactic errors occur, it captures the traceback, revises the code, and re-executes automatically.
    *   If the model produces infeasible/unbounded results, it diagnoses likely modeling issues (e.g., bad bounds, missing constraints, sign errors), revises the formulation, and reruns.
*   Validating successful solutions by:
    *   Performing sanity checks (e.g., constraint satisfaction, edge cases, units).
    *   Commenting on model reasonableness and recommending sensitivity analysis if needed.
*   Stopping iteration once the model passes all checks and explicitly stating, "Model and results verified: no further issues detected."

## 2. Key Features & UX Flow

The user experience will follow these general steps:

1.  **Enter/Paste Problem Statement**: The user provides the problem description in plain language.
    *   **System Response**: An NLP engine (powered by Gemini API) parses the input, and a draft OR model is displayed (LaTeX view with a collapsible plaintext option).
2.  **"Run in Solver" Button**: The user clicks to solve the formulated problem.
    *   **System Response**: Python code is auto-generated and executed in a sandboxed backend using PuLP or OR-Tools.
3.  **If Error**:
    *   **System Response**: The error is parsed, the code/model is auto-revised, and the solver is rerun (looping back to step 2 or a revised step 1).
4.  **If Success**:
    *   **System Response**: A solution table and charts (if applicable) are rendered. The "Validate" stage begins.
5.  **Validation Finds Issue**:
    *   **System Response**: The model is adjusted based on validation feedback, and the solver is rerun (looping back to step 2 or a revised step 1).
6.  **Validation Passes**:
    *   **System Response**: A final report is shown, and the application concludes the loop, stating: "Model and results verified: no further issues detected."

## 3. Core Technologies (Planned)

*   **AI Backend**: Gemini API for NLP, problem formulation, code generation, error diagnosis, and solution validation assistance.
*   **Solver**: Python with PuLP or Google OR-Tools.
*   **Mathematical Rendering**: LaTeX and plaintext.
*   **Platform**: Cross-platform (specific UI/framework TBD).
